    DML vs. DDL:
        DML manipulates data (SELECT, INSERT), DDL defines structure (CREATE, ALTER).

5.
    SQLite vs. SQL Server:
        SQLite: File-based, embedded, for lightweight apps.
        SQL Server: Server-based, enterprise-level, handles large apps.

    a. 
        DLL
            Drop table employees;: DDL
            Drop table departments;: DDL
            CREATE TABLE departments(...): DDL
            CREATE TABLE employees(...): DDL

        DML
            INSERT INTO departments VALUES ...: DML
            INSERT INTO employees VALUES ...: DML (repeated multiple times for various entries)
            Select * from departments;: DML
            Select * from employees;: DML
            SELECT designation, COUNT(*) AS nbr, (AVG(salary)) AS avg_salary ...: DML
            SELECT name, hired_on FROM employees ORDER BY hired_on;: DML

        Other:
            Select * from sqlite_master;: Other (because it's querying system catalog)
    b. See attached
    c. 
        The sqlite_master is SQLite's system table cataloging all database objects, including tables, indexes, views, and triggers. Each entry specifies the object's type (e.g., table or index), its name, the associated tbl_name, and the sql statement that created it. Querying this table provides an overview of the database's structure.
