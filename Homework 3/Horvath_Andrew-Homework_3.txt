1.
a. List all single rooms with a price below ₤20 per room.
π_roomNo, type, price(σ_type='single' AND price<20(Room))

b. List all guests currently staying at the Grosvenor Hotel. (assume the current date is 10/08/23)
π_guestName(σ_dateFrom≤'10/08/23' AND dateTo≥'10/08/23' AND hotelName='Grosvenor Hotel'(Booking ⨝ Hotel ⨝ Guest))

2. Write a SQL query to list the full details of all hotels in London. The result should be ordered by hotel name and price. Price should be displayed in descending order.

SELECT H.hotelName, H.city, R.roomNo, R.type, R.price
FROM dbo.Hotel H
JOIN dbo.Room R ON H.hotelNo = R.hotelNo
WHERE H.city = 'London'
ORDER BY H.hotelName, R.price DESC;

NO OUTPUT (To be expected, as Hotel.sql contained no hotels in London)

3. List the hotel names, guest names, guest addresses, and room numbers of all guests residing in all hotels. Order the results by hotel name, guest name, and guest address

SELECT H.hotelName, G.guestName, G.guestAddress, B.roomNo
FROM dbo.Booking B
JOIN dbo.Guest G ON B.guestNo = G.guestNo
JOIN dbo.Hotel H ON B.hotelNo = H.hotelNo
ORDER BY H.hotelName, G.guestName, G.guestAddress;
